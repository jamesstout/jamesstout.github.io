XXX Hi, I'm James - an English guy living in Hong Kong - into technology, photos, comedy, smashing telly, Apple, iOS/Mac development and, of course, the weather.

I'm on [Twitter][1] for day to day stuff and links. I sometimes post photos to [Instagram][3].

I do a bit of iPhone development and have an app on the iTunes AppStore - [HKWarnings][4]. More details can be found on my [iPhone development blog][6].

I'm on [GitHub][7] too. Some of my repos:

* [fail2ban-0.8.4-OpenSolaris][8] - Changes to get fail2ban-0.8.4 to run on OpenSolaris 5.11 snv_134 with `/usr/local/bin/python2.7`.
* [Alfred2-Workflows][9] - Some workflows for Alfred 2.
* [dotfiles][10] - My current working branch. See diffs [here][11].
* [ios-library_LITE][12] - A *lite* version of the official [Urban Airship iOS library][16]. The official library handles all of their [products][15], supports armv6 devices and does all sorts of logging and analysis. And it crashed a lot. My version just handles [de]registration and fixed the crashes. Plus, it's much smaller - 4 MB vs [16 MB][14]. You can see all the gunk I removed [here][13].

I also try to contribute to:

* [Spotweb][17] - a web-based usenet binary resource indexer.
* [iTerm2][18] - a terminal emulator for Mac OS X that does amazing things.
* [SVWebViewController][19] - a simple inline browser for iOS.
* [NYTPhotoViewer][24] - A modern [photo viewing experience](https://open.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/03/27/a-new-view-for-nytimes-photos/) for iOS.
* [OneSignal-iOS-SDK][25] - [OneSignal](https://onesignal.com/) is a free push notification service for mobile apps.

Also the occasional [Gist][20]:

* [verifyReceipt.php][21] - a script to verify iOS in-app purchase receipts
* [checkDodgyIPs.php][22] - look up the location of a list of IP addresses. Uses [ipinfodb.com][23]. Writes known IP info to a file to prevent repeat lookups.

Love [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and have a few repos on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/stoutyhk/).
e.g. [docker-phpservermonitor-nginx](https://hub.docker.com/r/stoutyhk/docker-phpservermonitor-nginx/) - source [here](https://bitbucket.org/stouty/docker-phpservermonitor-nginx/src).
