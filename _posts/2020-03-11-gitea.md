[Gitea](https://gitea.io/) is a painless self-hosted Git service. It's a community managed lightweight code hosting solution written in Go, similar to GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab.[^fn-gitea]

I've used GitHub - code on someone else's server.[^fn-cloud]

I've used Bitbucket - ditto.

I've used GitLab on my [NAS](https://global.download.synology.com/download/Document/Hardware/DataSheet/DiskStation/17-year/DS1817+/enu/Synology_DS1817_Plus_Data_Sheet_enu.pdf) in a [Docker container](https://www.synology.com/en-global/dsm/feature/docker) - but what a faff. GitLab is a beast.

Then I discovered Gitea, with all the [features](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/#features) I need, in a blazingly fast package.

Here's a [comparison table](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/comparison/) with the other self hosted options:

<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">[[Biggify]](/assets/images/posts/gitea/gitea-general.png)</span>

<img data-src="{% asset_path gitea-code.png %}" src="{% asset_path gitea-code-lq.png %}" class="lazyload blur-up" alt="gitea code functionality comparison"/>
<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">[[Biggify]](/assets/images/posts/gitea/gitea-code.png)</span>

You can try out a Gitea demo [here](https://try.gitea.io/).

I opted to host on a subdomain of stouty.xyz with a [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) database, and the [binary install](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/install-from-binary/), running behind [nginx](https://docs.gitea.io/en-us/reverse-proxies/) over HTTPS of [course](https://www.troyhunt.com/the-6-step-happy-path-to-https/).

My nginx config wasn't as straightforward as in the Gitea docs, as I wanted to enforce HTTPS and use Let's Encrypt for SSL certificates. I needed to set a few `proxy_set_header` options. A snippet of my conf is below:

And here it is...

### Dashboard

### Repo View
<img data-src="{% asset_path repo-view.png %}" class="lazyload blur-up" alt="gitea repo-view"/>
<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">[[Biggify]](/assets/images/posts/gitea/repo-view.png)</span>

### Commit Diff

In the above commit, I'm fixing my use of `[NSData description]`. [iOS 13 changed the format of descriptions](https://mjtsai.com/blog/2019/09/17/breaking-the-nsdata-description-contract/) for Foundation objects, including NSData:

> Was Apple irresponsible in making this particular change?
> No, not really — developers shouldn’t have relied on a specific format for an object’s [description](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/objectivec/1418956-nsobject/1418746-description?language=objc).

In conclusion, I'm very happy to have found Gitea. Oh, and if you want to migrate from GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab, they have automated migration tools:

Might be time to learn [Go](https://golang.org/) and see if I can [contribute](https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea).
