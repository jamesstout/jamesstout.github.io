excerpt: Zoom for Mac has fixed its dodgy entitlements.
---

[Zoom](https://zoom.us/) for macOS versions < v4.6.9 had a very dodgy installer, detailed extensively by [Patrick Wardle](https://objective-see.com/blog/blog_0x56.html) and by [Felix Seele](https://www.vmray.com/cyber-security-blog/zoom-macos-installer-analysis-good-apps-behaving-badly/).

The app itself had entitlements to circumvent the [hardened runtime](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/hardened_runtime?language=objc) on the Mac:

Per Patrick:

>However the com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation entitlement is interesting. In short it tells macOS, “hey, yah I still (kinda?) want the “Hardened Runtime”, but please allow any libraries to be loaded into my address space” …in other words, library injections are a go!

Zoom responded fairly quickly with an [update](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201361963-New-Updates-for-macOS):

* Resolved an issue where a malicious party with local access could tamper with the Zoom installer to gain additional privileges to the computer
* Resolved an issue where a malicious party with local access could gain access to a user’s webcam and microphone

So now let's check the entitlements again:

`com.apple.security.cs.disable-library-validation` is gone, closing the security hole.

I still don't trust it, so will be checking out [alternatives](https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/1/21202945/zoom-alternative-conference-video-free-app-skype-slack-hangouts-jitsi).
