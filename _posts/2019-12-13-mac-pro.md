Back in June 2019, Apple [announced the new Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/hk/en/newsroom/2019/06/apple-unveils-powerful-all-new-mac-pro-and-groundbreaking-pro-display-xdr/):

> Designed for maximum performance, expansion and configurability, the all-new [Mac Pro](https://www.apple.com/mac-pro/) features workstation-class Xeon processors up to 28 cores, a high-performance memory system with a massive 1.5TB capacity, eight PCIe expansion slots and a graphics architecture featuring the worldâ€™s most powerful graphics card.

As usual, when a new machine comes out from Apple, we head to the configuration page and max it out.

### Fully-loaded Mac Pro

That's:

And that's without a display. The [Pro Display XDR](https://www.apple.com/pro-display-xdr/) is $46k:

So, a total of around $457k! Not for me. Let's spec a reasonable Mac Pro and iMac Pro.

### Reasonable Mac Pro

You can get [reasonable 5k monitors](https://www.lifewire.com/best-5k-and-8k-computer-monitors-4589159) for around $7k.

Total: ~$74k.

### Reasonable iMac Pro

<span style="font-size: 0.6em;">[[Biggify]](/assets/images/posts/mac-pro/imac-pro-reasonable.png)</span>

Total: $56k.

For comparison, a fully-loaded iMac 27in with Retina 5K display is $34k:
