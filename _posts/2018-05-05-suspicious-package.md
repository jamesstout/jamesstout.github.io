I always try to view package contents when I download a `.pkg` file, with something like [Pacifist](https://www.charlessoft.com/). The other day, doing that installed some malware:

I hadn't run it, just opened in Pacifist. [Bitdefender](https://www.bitdefender.com/solutions/antivirus-for-mac.html) caught and deleted it, but itâ€™s the first time I've seen malware on my Mac.

After that scare, I found [Suspicious Package](http://www.mothersruin.com/software/SuspiciousPackage/) from Mothers Ruin Software:
>Suspicious Package: An Application for Inspecting macOS Installer Packages
>
>* Do you know what files that macOS Installer package actually installs?
>* Do you know what scripts it runs during installation, and what they do?
>* Do you know who the package really came from?
>
>With Suspicious Package, you can answer these questions and more. Maybe you're quite literally suspicious of a package you've downloaded. Or perhaps you're just curious about what some package does. Or maybe you want to find out after the fact exactly what files a package scattered across your computer. Whatever the reason, Suspicious Package allows you to see inside an installer package. (And it's completely free.)
